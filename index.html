        <p>
          My name is Jerome Joseph Magolan III and I am 37 years old. I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and moved to
          Raleigh, NC when I was 4 years old. I was raised in Raleigh and attended the University of North Carolina at
          Wilmington for college; graduating with a degree in Communications Studies.
        </p>

        <p>
          After college I moved to Blacksburg, Virgina to pursue a career racing sports cars with Bimmerworld Racing. At
          the time we fielded 3 BMW 325i's in the Pirelli World Challenge. I started as a fly-in crew member while in
          college and was hired full time out of college as a car cheif. After a couple years on the race team I moved
          to the front office managing the buisness in order to pursue my own career racing with a Spec E30 car which I
          built with the skills I had learned on the race team.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few years later I moved back to the Raleigh area and settled in Durham. I currently ride my 1976 Harley
          Davidson which I built from an untouched frame to the chopper it has become. I can be found around town riding
          my motorcycle, watching football or attending the Carolina Hurricanes home games.
